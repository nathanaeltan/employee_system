# README - Employee System Assignment 

## Technologies used
- Ruby
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Rails 
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
- Active Storage


## Approach
- As the initial instructions stated a CRUD application, I chose Ruby on Rails as it would ease the process of dealing with all CRUD actions.
- This left me more time to deal with the main issue which was accessing the hiearchy of each employee in the SHOW route. 
- I created an ERD of what a table would look like deciding finally to go with a single employee table that has an ID, a name, and a manager_id which would be referencing the employee's ID.(Shown Below)
